# PL/SQL Oracle APEX Project

A complete Oracle APEX application package including database schema, application export, and test data.

## Project Structure

```
├── ddl.sql          # Database schema (tables, constraints, indexes)
├── app.sql          # Oracle APEX application export
└── fakedata.sql     # Sample data for testing
```

## Files Description

### `ddl.sql` — Database Schema
Contains all DDL (Data Definition Language) statements required to set up the database objects used by the application. This includes:
- Table definitions
- Primary and foreign key constraints
- Indexes

> Run this script **first** before any other script.

### `app.sql` — Oracle APEX Application
The full export of the Oracle APEX application. This file is generated by APEX and contains all application components including pages, regions, items, processes, and navigation.

> Must be imported via the APEX Application Builder or SQL\*Plus after the schema is in place.

### `fakedata.sql` — Test Data
Contains `INSERT` statements that populate the tables with realistic sample data for development and testing purposes.

> Run this script **after** both `ddl.sql` and the APEX app import are complete.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Oracle Database (12c or higher recommended)
- Oracle APEX (compatible version installed and configured)
- SQL\*Plus or SQLcl, or access to APEX SQL Workshop

### Setup Steps

**1. Create the schema objects**
```sql
@ddl.sql
```

**2. Import the APEX application**

Option A — via APEX Application Builder:
1. Log in to your APEX workspace
2. Go to **App Builder → Import**
3. Select `app.sql` and follow the import wizard

Option B — via SQL\*Plus:
```sql
@app.sql
```

**3. Load test data**
```sql
@fakedata.sql
```

## Notes

- Make sure you are connected to the correct Oracle schema/workspace before running any script.
- The `fakedata.sql` script is intended for **development and testing only** — do not run it in production.
- If re-running the setup, drop existing tables or truncate them before executing `ddl.sql` and `fakedata.sql` to avoid conflicts.
